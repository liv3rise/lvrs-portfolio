# lvrs-portfolio

My first attempt at creating my own portfolio which consists of

👋 greetings where I tell a little about myself

🔧 showing some of my work (which doesn't exist yet huh)

✉️ as well as the contacts section.

*The work is still in progress, this is not the final version.*

## 🗒️ ToDo

- [x] ~~switching light and dark theme 2023-07-02~~
- [x] ~~copying Discord tag to clipboard when clicking on its link 2023-21-02~~
- [x] ~~a couple of animations 2023-24-02~~
- [x] ~~more animations! 2023-27-02~~
- [x] ~~form validation 2023-27-02~~
- [ ] more information
- [ ] perhaps a custom backend server for processing forms (currently, forms are processed through netlify)
- [ ] if the project grows, perhaps migrating to some framework in the future if necessary
