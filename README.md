# lvrs-portfolio

My first attempt at creating my own portfolio which consists of

üëã greetings where I tell a little about myself

üîß showing some of my work (which doesn't exist yet huh)

‚úâÔ∏è as well as the contacts section.

*The work is still in progress, this is not the final version.*
