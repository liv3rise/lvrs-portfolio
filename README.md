# lvrs-portfolio

My first attempt at creating my own portfolio which consists of

üëã greetings where I tell a little about myself

üîß showing some of my work (which doesn't exist yet huh)

‚úâÔ∏è as well as the contacts section.

*The work is still in progress, this is not the final version.*

## ToDo

- [x] ~~switching light and dark theme 2023-07-02~~
- [ ] improved form submission (currently, forms are processed through netlify)
- [ ] a couple of animations
- [ ] copying Discord tag to clipboard when clicking on its link
- [ ] more information
- [ ] if the project grows, perhaps migrating to some framework in the future if necessary
